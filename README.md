## Introduction
This is an NPC Generator for TTRPGs (notable D&D). It is a JS react app that uses a Ruby API backend that can be found at (<https://github.com/ph3nomforko/npc-generator-backend>).

## Getting Started
To get started, download the backend and frontend files from GitHub. Next, open the backend and run `bundle install` and `rails db:migrate && db:seed` to get some starting data. Then, open the frontend documents and run `npm install`. Finally, `npm start` and your react app, NPC generator should open up.

## Using the App
The app is organized around NPC occupations/roles. This allows you to quickly find that *bartender* you need or create an NPC that is a *Flying Taxi*. Once you have picked or created your role/occupation. You can view the NPCs associated with it or create a new one. The NPC creation tool also gives you a quick and easy method to randomly generate an NPC with some basic framework. You can tweak the randomized NPC, or just create them, as is. Made a mistake or need to use that NPC again but with some changes? The app allows you to edit or delete NPCs as well.

Enjoy!
